## Overview
>Economic indicators are used to measure the strength of a country's economy. In this project, the concern is about the continents at large. Several economic indexes are considered in this project namely, agriculture, import, export, services, and industrial contribution to the world economy. This project is aimed at exploring how the world economy has performed over the years.

# Data Wrangling
## Data Gathering
> - dataset relating to agriculture,  export, import, services, and industry were gathered from [Gap Minder](https://gapminder.org/data/) and they contain their respective historical data.
>- While the continent dataset was collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/continents-according-to-our-world-in-data).

### Data Cleaning
> All datasets gathered from gapminder were in wide format and as such, they had to be converted to long format. Data gathered from another source, [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/continents-according-to-our-world-in-data) was merged to form a single dataset. Other qualities and tidiness issues were addressed before the analysis commenced.

## Focus of the Analysis
>- How has the world economy performed over the years?
>- What is the general trend displayed by all continents?
>- How do they differ in economic activities?

## Summary of Findings
>Broadly speaking, in all the countries there has been an increase in economic activities leading to economic growth over the years. However, the growth varied from one continent to the other. It's also found that Asia's domination in terms of overall GDP is a result of an economic boost from a major industrialized economy owing to the presence of crude oil.
### Python Libraries used
